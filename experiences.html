          in order to refer to sources, and study different arguments. At first, in term 1, my performence was not that great,
          and I use to have a fear of the subject. Despite this, I gradually started to improve, and now if we look at my term 2
          performence, it varies by great amount, showcasing my overall understanding of the subject.

      <h1>Reflection; ICT was not a new subject for me, as we had already faced it in 6th and 7th, however it was a subjectthat required more practice and hardwork
          on my side, as I am not good in understanding the different uses of softwares and technology. We had learnt about
          using different softwares like flogorithm, Photoshop, Animate, Access. In all of them, I gave my best effort,
          explored them on my own, and got excellent marks. I plan to continue the same for future.
