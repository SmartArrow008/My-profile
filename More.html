      <h1> Apart from the studies in school, and the main subjects we worked on during this grade, in terms of extracuricular 
        activities, I have also been taking up coding classes, from the organization, whitehat junior. Within this process of learning
        We learnt the programming language java script, and used it to make apps, games. Then we recently started working on html, from which this
        very website is coded. Below is some of my work, including appas and games, that can be accessed by pressing onto the images.
